# Museo di Maranello

The Museo di Maranello, or Museum of Maranello in English is an entirely HTML and CSS project designed to showcase the history of some of Ferrari's most memorable and iconic vehicles. Designed to be experienced as either a 'walk-through' style tour or a reference page to learn more

## Design, UI, and UX

In taking inspiration from Ferrari's principal colour schemes - the website was centred around the following colour pallete:
<img src="assets/ferrari-palette.png" width="100%">

I wanted this site to emulate and capture the feeling of entering an interactive museum and having the option to either explore at one's own pace as they browse through the different exhibits or experience a 'curated' path/journey that a tour guide would offer. 

## Components
* Loading feature
..* Whilst buffering/loading the page I wanted the user to immediately feel engaged by the sporting history of Ferrari. In order to achieve this I added an F1 styled starting lights animation. 



## Testing and Validation

* HTML
* CSS
