      <h1>A Golden Era: 1970-1999</h1>
      <p>
        Some of Ferrari's most iconic cars come from this period of time. Cars
        like the F40, the 512, and the Testarossa may have been plastered upon
        your childhood bedrooms.

      />
      <p>
        The iconic and much-admired Ferrari F40 was the last Ferrari to receive
        Enzo Ferrari's personal approval. This mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive
        sports car was produced between the late 1980s to early 1990s. The F40
        was the successor to the 288 GTO and was designed and built to celebrate
        Ferrari's 40th Anniversary. Only 400 were ever produced and each unit
        sold for around $400,000.
