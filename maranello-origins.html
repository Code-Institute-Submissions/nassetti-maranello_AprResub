      <h1>Humble Beginnings</h1>
      <p>
        Every story has to start somewhere and this one starts in 1929 with
        Scuderia Ferrari, or in English: The Ferrari Stable. Headquarted in
        Modena, Italy, Enzo Ferrari started out preparing Alfa Romeos for what
        they called "gentleman racers" until eventually he wanted to do his own
        thing. So in 1939 he did! As you can see below, that's when Maranello
        truly got on its feet and people started to see what Enzo could do. To

      <h1>So How was Ferrari Born?</h1>
      <p>
        The story of Ferrari begins in around 1929 when Enzo Ferrari formed
        Scuderia Ferrari, based in Modena, Italy. Scuderia Ferrari bought,
        repaired, and fielded Alfa Romeo racing cars for "gentlemen drivers" and
        in 1933 took over Alfa Romeo's racing team. When Alfa Romeo brought its
        racing team back in-house in 1938, they hired Enzo Ferrari as manager of
        the new racing department. In 1939, Ferrari left Alfa Romeo and agreed
        that he would not use the Ferrari name for races or racing cars for at
        least four years. He founded Auto Avio Costruzioni, to produce machine
        tools and aircraft accessories. The new company did however produce a
        race car, in 1940, the Tipo 815, which was based on a Fiat platform. In
        1943, the Ferrari factory moved to Maranello. It was bombed by the
        Allies during WWII. It was rebuilt and is still the main site of Ferrari
        production to this day. The company became what we know as Ferrari today
        in 1947 when their cars began to sport their famous horse logo.

      <h1>When Was the First Ferrari Built</h1>
      <p>
        The first-ever Ferrari, though not technically speaking called a
        Ferrari, as the Auto Avio Costruzioni 815. This was a two-seater
        Barchetta that had a 1.5-liter engine under the hood. The "Tipo 815" was
        built in 1940 and only two were ever built. Both of these raced at the
        1940 Brescia Grand Prix but both failed to finish due to engine
        problems. facts about Ferrari Tipo 815 One of them was later scrapped,
        but the other surviving car is currently in a car collection in Italy.
        Ferrari was unable to call it a Ferrari as he was still under contract
        with Alfa Romeo at the time. Although he had left the company the terms
        and conditions of his release prevented him from building a car under
        his own name for a time. For this reason, he had to think of an
        alternative name. And so, without further ado, here are some interesting
        facts about the company and their amazing cars. This list is far from
        exhaustive and is in no particular order.
